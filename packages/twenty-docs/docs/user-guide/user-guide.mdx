# Welcome to Twenty's User Guide

The purpose of this user guide is to help you learn how you can use Twenty to build the CRM you want. 

This quick-start guide walks you through the basics.

## Quick Search 

You'll see a search bar at the top of your sidebar. You can also bring up the command bar with the `cmd`/`ctrl` + `k` shortcut to navigate through your workspace, and find people, companies, notes, and more. 

The command bar also supports other shortcuts for navigation.  

## Create Pre-filtered Views 

Twenty allows you to add filters to see data that meets certain criteria and hides the rest. 

To create a filter in your workspace, click Filter at the top right and select the attribute you'd like to filter your records by. Create your filter and then save changes in a new view by clicking `+ Create view`. 

The filtered view is now available to your whole team.

## Add Stages For Opportunities

You can also add more stages to the opportunities board. 

On the Opportunities page, click on Options, Stages, then `+ Add Stage`.

You can also edit the stage by clicking on the name.
