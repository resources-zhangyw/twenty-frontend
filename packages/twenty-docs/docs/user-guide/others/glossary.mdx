The CRM has two fundamental types of records:
- A `Company` represents a business or organization.
- `People` represent your company's current and prospective customers or clients.

A `Pipeline` is a way to track a business process. Pipelines are present within a *module* and have *stages*:
- A **module** contains the logic for a certain business process (for example: sales, recruiting).
- **Stages** map the steps in your process (for example: new, ongoing, won, lost).

It has a single domain name, which is typically the domain name your company uses for employee email addresses.
